The one that always made me think and feel something real and important was "Fear is the mind-killer", which i heard a long time ago during the [Dune](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/) and i found out today, it's origin:

> I must not fear.
>
> Fear is the mind-killer.
>
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
>
> I will face my fear.
>
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
>
> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
>
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
>
> Only I will remain.
