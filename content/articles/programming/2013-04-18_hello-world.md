Starting a new blog based on [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) and will import some older posts from my old Posterous-dead website.

I'm a Python/Javascript developer, Linux/OSX lover with a thing for devops. There are some cool posts i intend to write, for example how to write better code when you're not a rockstar, how to run applications on [OpenShift](http://openshift.com).

I'm also a Django developer (write web applications with Django, not a commiter) and love [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.com), so i hope to write more about those as well.

That is all, have fun!
